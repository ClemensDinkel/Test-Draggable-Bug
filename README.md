This Repo has been created to test whether react-draggable actually swallows touch(end?) events thus preventing onClick events on touch devices or whether this problem only occurs using the google chrome touch emulator in the dev tools. 

Observations made beforehand:
- Firefox's touch emulator doesn't seem to have problems with react-draggable so the conclusion lies ahead that it's really a problem of the chrome touch emulator.
